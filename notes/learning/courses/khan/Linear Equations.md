# Two variable linear equations

<https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/two-var-linear-equations>

The rules:

1. All $(x, y)$ pairs that satisfy the equation lie on a line
2. Can only consist of:
  * constants (i.e. $12$, $-3$)
  * constants multiplied by a variable to the first power (i.e. $2x$, $-4y$)

Whilst the first is true, and gives the equations their name, it is hard to prove just by looking at the equation. The second rule is easy to use to test an equation just by looking at it.

### Examples

> $y = 2x - 3$

|  x   |  y |
|---   |--- |
|  0   | -3 |
|  1   | -1 |
| -0.5 |  -4 |  
|  5   |  7 |

> $4x - 3y = 12$

| x |  y |
|---|--- |
| 0 | -4 |
| 3 |  0 |

### Not linear

> x is to the power of two (only variables to the first power make lines)

$y = x^2$ 

> x is multiplied by y (only multiplication by constants make lines)

$xy = 12$

> 5 is divided by x (only multiplication makes lines)

$5/x + y = 10$
