In order to use this folder in the Obsidian app we need to have several things in place:

1. We need to have Python 3 installed
2. We need to create a virtualenv in this folder
3. We need to have the contents of the `requirements.txt` file in this folder installed
4. We need to install the [Obsidian Jupyter](https://github.com/tillahoffmann/obsidian-jupyter) community plugin installed
5. We need to run code within codeblocks marked as language `jupyter` rather than have traditional `ipynb` files
