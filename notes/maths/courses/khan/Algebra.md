# Introduction

The word **algebra** comes from the Arabic word _al-gabr_ for "restoration" or "completion". It was coined, we believe, in one of the seminal works on algebra, which was written by a guy called _al Kwarizmi_ in Baghdad in 820AD. This refers to the operation of taking something from one side of an equation to the other side of that equation. al Kwarizmi didn't invent algebra though. Concepts related to algebra have around since ~2000BC in ancient babylon. The greek mathematician Diophantus is sometimes credited with being the grandfather of algebra (often by western historians) as he also pre-dates al Kwarizmi, but there have been a lot of people that have contributed along the way. In 600AD, in India, Brahma Gupta was also contributing ideas to algebra.

**Cartesian** is named after **Rene Descartes** who invented the visualizing of the algebraic relationship between $x$ and $y$ on a 2-dimensional graph, called a **Cartesian plane**. He got this idea from _Eucleidian Geometry_ where we draw shapes in 2 or 3 dimensional planes in order to visualize the abstract concepts of geometry. Algebraic equations that model the relationship between $x$ and $y$ are called **linear equations** because when $y$ is found for given values of $x$ the resulting cartesian coordinates drawn on a graph form a _line_. For example, with the following equation we will always end up with a y value that is 1 greater than the given $x$ value:

$$
y = x + 1
$$
# Linear equations

## Two variable linear equations

The rules:

1. All $(x, y)$ pairs that satisfy the equation lie on a line
2. Can only consist of:
  * constants (i.e. $12$, $-3$)
  * constants multiplied by a variable to the first power (i.e. $2x$, $-4y$)

Whilst the first is true, and gives the equations their name, it is hard to prove just by looking at the equation. The second rule is easy to use to test an equation just by looking at it.

### Examples - linear

> $y = 2x - 3$

|  x   |  y |
|---   |--- |
|  0   | -3 |
|  1   | -1 |
| -0.5 |  -4 |  
|  5   |  7 |

> $4x - 3y = 12$

| x |  y |
|---|--- |
| 0 | -4 |
| 3 |  0 |

### Examples - non-linear

> x is to the power of two (only variables to the first power make lines)

$y = x^2$ 

> x is multiplied by y (only multiplication by constants make lines)

$xy = 12$

> 5 is divided by x (only multiplication makes lines)

$5/x + y = 10$
